    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-02</p>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This application (“App”) is a personal tool used to connect to your bank via EnableBanking and import
      your transaction data into <em>Actual Budget</em>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> the email address configured for this application in EnableBanking.</p>

    <h2>2) What data the App accesses</h2>
    <p>
      If you authorize access, the App may access read-only account information and transaction data via the
      EnableBanking Account Information Service (AIS), which may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account identifiers (e.g. IBAN), account name, currency</li>
      <li>Balances (if enabled in the consent)</li>
      <li>Transactions (amount, date, counterparty/payee info when provided by the bank, references/notes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Why the App accesses this data</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses this data only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fetch your transactions from your bank via EnableBanking</li>
      <li>Import those transactions into your Actual Budget file so you can track your spending</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Where the data is stored</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed for personal use and runs locally. Imported transactions are stored in your Actual
      Budget data store (local/self-hosted).
    </p>
    <p>
      The App stores minimal technical data locally to keep the connection working, such as an EnableBanking
      session token and the list of available accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Sharing of data</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not sell your data and does not share your data with third parties, except as required to
      make the connection work (i.e. your bank and EnableBanking as the API provider).
    </p>

    <h2>6) Security</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses HTTPS to communicate with EnableBanking. Your private RSA key is stored on your computer
      and is used only to sign API requests. You are responsible for keeping your device and keys secure.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Data retention and deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Transactions imported into Actual remain there until you delete them. You can revoke bank access by
      revoking the consent in your bank/EnableBanking. You can also delete the App’s local state files from
      your computer.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      If this policy changes, the “Last updated” date will be updated.
